                            Our fundamental political approach can be simply stated: We consistently and universally uphold the moral-political principle
                            of individual rights.
                            <br>
                            <br> We categorically oppose any version or variation of statism, any social system that denies an
                            individual's inalienable rights and subordinates his/her life to the state. On any issue, in
                            every context, concerning all individuals, regardless of gender, race, nationality, religion,
                            and the like,
                            <br>
                            <span class="quote"> we support an individual's right to his or her own life.</span>
                            <br>
                            <br> Rights are fact-based requirements of human life in a social setting, without which an individual
                            cannot even survive, much less flourish, a truth tragically and repeatedly attested to by every
                            murderous dictatorship on earth. Rights are not bestowed by the state, nor can it repeal them;
                            the state exists solely to uphold them. We therefore stand firmly with the Founders of the United
                            States of America:
                            <br>

                            <span class="quote">
                                Rights are inalienable moral principles the protection of which forms the sole reason human beings require government.
                            </span>
                            <br>
                            <br> Indeed, we are the modern intellectual heirs of the American Founders, the only contemporary
                            political party consistently and unequivocally dedicated to implementing their moral-political
                            vision.
                            <br>
                            <br>


                            <span class="bold">We support an individual's inalienable rights in all arenas of life</span>
                            <br> —in the realms of personal morality, of economics, of self-defense, and regarding any other
                            issue that might confront us. The government of a free nation must fully respect and vigilantly
                            protect every individual's freedom of speech, freedom of intellectual expression, and freedom
                            of religion; equally so his or her right to own property, to earn profit, and to retain all wealth
                            honestly earned; similarly, his or her inalienable right to bear arms and to deploy them, if
                            necessary, in self-defense. An individual possesses inviolable sovereignty over both his or her
                            own mind and body—and to the effort, the content, and the output of each.
                            <br>
                            <br> We recognize that there are no rights in the absence of property rights; for if criminals or
                            the government can seize a man's home, his food, his bank account, his wallet, or the like, then
                            he is left no means to survive. All property must be owned privately, and the owner's right to
                            its use and disposal must be stringently, unambiguously, and exceptionlessly protected by the
                            government of a free society.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <span class="bold">We unequivocally repudiate the notion, in any and all forms, of "group rights."</span>
                            <br> The claim that some collective based on class, race, gender, or so forth, has special rights
                            not possessed by others pits pressure group against pressure group, exhorting government to violate
                            the rights of one side in alleged "benefit" to the other. We recognize that in any struggle between
                            classes, races, and the like, the individual is the one whose rights are inevitably violated.
                            We recognize and emphasize that upholding the principle of individual rights is the sole means
                            to end racism. When a human being is recognized to be first, foremost, and always an individual—not
                            a member of a group, racial or otherwise—possessing the right to his or her life, possessing
                            all the rights of an honest individual, only then can humanity definitively terminate racial
                            bigotry in any and all of its hideous iterations.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <span class="bold">To protect the right to life of all human individuals,</span>
                            <br> we support a universal ban on the initiation of force, including on governments, as well as
                            on private individuals. Physical coercion is to be employed solely in retaliation and only against
                            those who initiate its use.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <span class="bold">We uphold limited Constitutional government,</span>
                            <br> whereby the government restrains private force initiators—criminals—and a written Constitution,
                            unambiguously worded, stringently limits the government to an utterly retaliatory use of force.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <span class="bold">We maintain that an individual right applies to action, not to outcome; to productive activity,
                                not to goods or services; to the pursuit of happiness, not to its guarantee.</span>
                            <br> We reject the idea that an individual has a "right" to food or housing or medical care or the
                            like, for that ensures governmental initiation of force against innocent individuals to provide
                            such things, thereby violating the right of producers to retain the product of their effort.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <span class="bold">There can be no "right" to violate the rights of others.</span>
                            <br> Rather, we assert that rights are never in conflict, for they involve the freedom of all individuals
                            to honestly pursue, by their own effort or with the voluntary assistance of others, the values
                            upon which their fulfillment and happiness depend.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <span class="bold">A human life is an integrated whole</span>
                            <br> —of personal morality and economic activity, education and career, love and finances, mind and
                            body. Because of this, we recognize that dividing issues into neat categories of economics or
                            personal morality or self-defense is—at best—inexact. Nevertheless, although any important policy
                            will necessarily impact all aspects of human life, a specific policy may most affect one area
                            more than others. With this in mind, we divide our policy recommendations into three broad classifications:
                            Upholding Individual Rights Regarding Economic Issues, Upholding Individual Rights Regarding
                            Issues of Personal Morality, Upholding Individual Rights Regarding Issues of National-and-Self-Defense.
                            <br>
                            <br> We strenuously maintain that
                            <span class="quote">the moral is the practical</span>—and
                            <span class="quote">the immoral is the impractical</span>. The morally right—the protection of individual rights
                            in every arena and on all issues—leads, in every instance, to profoundly positive, life-enhancing
                            results. Conversely, the abrogation of individual rights leads inevitably to pernicious, life-harming
                            consequences.

                                <br> We are, consequently, the only political party consistently dedicated to the flourishing of
                                human life on earth. Every specific policy we endorse, in every field, on every issue confronting
                                the country, is, without exception, designed with two goals in mind:

                                Our fundamental political approach can be simply stated: We consistently and universally uphold the moral-political principle
                                of individual rights.
                                <br>
                                <br> We categorically oppose any version or variation of statism, any social system that denies an
                                individual's inalienable rights and subordinates his/her life to the state. On any issue, in
                                every context, concerning all individuals, regardless of gender, race, nationality, religion,
                                and the like,
                                <br>
                                <span class="quote"> we support an individual's right to his or her own life.</span>
                                <br>
                                <br> Rights are fact-based requirements of human life in a social setting, without which an individual
                                cannot even survive, much less flourish, a truth tragically and repeatedly attested to by every
                                murderous dictatorship on earth. Rights are not bestowed by the state, nor can it repeal them;
                                the state exists solely to uphold them. We therefore stand firmly with the Founders of the United
                                States of America:
                                <br>
    
                                <span class="quote">
                                    Rights are inalienable moral principles the protection of which forms the sole reason human beings require government.
                                </span>
                                <br>
                                <br> Indeed, we are the modern intellectual heirs of the American Founders, the only contemporary
                                political party consistently and unequivocally dedicated to implementing their moral-political
                                vision.
                                <br>
                                <br>
    
    
                                <span class="bold">We support an individual's inalienable rights in all arenas of life</span>
                                <br> —in the realms of personal morality, of economics, of self-defense, and regarding any other
                                issue that might confront us. The government of a free nation must fully respect and vigilantly
                                protect every individual's freedom of speech, freedom of intellectual expression, and freedom
                                of religion; equally so his or her right to own property, to earn profit, and to retain all wealth
                                honestly earned; similarly, his or her inalienable right to bear arms and to deploy them, if
                                necessary, in self-defense. An individual possesses inviolable sovereignty over both his or her
                                own mind and body—and to the effort, the content, and the output of each.
                                <br>
                                <br> We recognize that there are no rights in the absence of property rights; for if criminals or
                                the government can seize a man's home, his food, his bank account, his wallet, or the like, then
                                he is left no means to survive. All property must be owned privately, and the owner's right to
                                its use and disposal must be stringently, unambiguously, and exceptionlessly protected by the
                                government of a free society.
                                <br>
                                <br>
    
                                <span class="bold">We unequivocally repudiate the notion, in any and all forms, of "group rights."</span>
                                <br> The claim that some collective based on class, race, gender, or so forth, has special rights
                                not possessed by others pits pressure group against pressure group, exhorting government to violate
                                the rights of one side in alleged "benefit" to the other. We recognize that in any struggle between
                                classes, races, and the like, the individual is the one whose rights are inevitably violated.
                                We recognize and emphasize that upholding the principle of individual rights is the sole means
                                to end racism. When a human being is recognized to be first, foremost, and always an individual—not
                                a member of a group, racial or otherwise—possessing the right to his or her life, possessing
                                all the rights of an honest individual, only then can humanity definitively terminate racial
                                bigotry in any and all of its hideous iterations.
                                <br>
                                <br>
    
                                <span class="bold">To protect the right to life of all human individuals,</span>
                                <br> we support a universal ban on the initiation of force, including on governments, as well as
                                on private individuals. Physical coercion is to be employed solely in retaliation and only against
                                those who initiate its use.
                                <br>
                                <br>
    
                                <span class="bold">We uphold limited Constitutional government,</span>
                                <br> whereby the government restrains private force initiators—criminals—and a written Constitution,
                                unambiguously worded, stringently limits the government to an utterly retaliatory use of force.
                                <br>
                                <br>
    
                                <span class="bold">We maintain that an individual right applies to action, not to outcome; to productive activity,
                                    not to goods or services; to the pursuit of happiness, not to its guarantee.</span>
                                <br> We reject the idea that an individual has a "right" to food or housing or medical care or the
                                like, for that ensures governmental initiation of force against innocent individuals to provide
                                such things, thereby violating the right of producers to retain the product of their effort.
                                <br>
                                <br>
    
                                <span class="bold">There can be no "right" to violate the rights of others.</span>
                                <br> Rather, we assert that rights are never in conflict, for they involve the freedom of all individuals
                                to honestly pursue, by their own effort or with the voluntary assistance of others, the values
                                upon which their fulfillment and happiness depend.
                                <br>
                                <br>
    
                                <span class="bold">A human life is an integrated whole</span>
                                <br> —of personal morality and economic activity, education and career, love and finances, mind and
                                body. Because of this, we recognize that dividing issues into neat categories of economics or
                                personal morality or self-defense is—at best—inexact. Nevertheless, although any important policy
                                will necessarily impact all aspects of human life, a specific policy may most affect one area
                                more than others. With this in mind, we divide our policy recommendations into three broad classifications:
                                Upholding Individual Rights Regarding Economic Issues, Upholding Individual Rights Regarding
                                Issues of Personal Morality, Upholding Individual Rights Regarding Issues of National-and-Self-Defense.
                                <br>
                                <br> We strenuously maintain that
                                <span class="quote">the moral is the practical</span>—and
                                <span class="quote">the immoral is the impractical</span>. The morally right—the protection of individual rights
                                in every arena and on all issues—leads, in every instance, to profoundly positive, life-enhancing
                                results. Conversely, the abrogation of individual rights leads inevitably to pernicious, life-harming
                                consequences.
