                            <p id="stateEconomy" class="flow-text">
                                There should exist a strict legal separation of state and economy in the United States, just as, and for the same reason,
                                there exists a legal separation of state and church. Just as religious belief and practice
                                is—properly—a matter of private choice and initiative, so are men's economic choices and
                                activities. As long as individuals are not criminals—i.e., as long as they do not initiate
                                force or fraud against innocent victims—their right to their own beliefs, their own choices,
                                and their own activities, material as well as spiritual, must be upheld and protected by
                                the legal system. The first clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states,
                                <br>

                                <span class="quote">"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
                                    exercise thereof…"</span>
                                <br>
                                <br> We full-mindedly and wholeheartedly agree. Similarly, we support a Constitutional amendment
                                stating,
                                <br>

                                <span class="quote">"Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of economic regulations, or restricting
                                    the free exercise of voluntary production and trade."</span>
                                <br>
                                <br> If business persons, like religious persons or clergy, initiate force or fraud, they should
                                be properly prosecuted under the laws of the criminal justice system. But if they initiate
                                neither force nor fraud, then the government must be constitutionally debarred from interfering
                                with their activities. Two centuries of capitalism and millennia of statism demonstrate two
                                practical conclusions: When men's rights are protected to freely engage in production and
                                trade, immense advances result in innovations, in creation of both material and intellectual
                                wealth, in living standards, and in human life expectancies—but when men's rights to voluntarily
                                produce and trade are curtailed by government, when statism in any form is rampant, then
                                progress ceases, the creation of wealth plummets, living standards diminish, and life expectancies
                                decline.

                                We support the full freedom of U.S. energy producers to develop natural resources on the land they own or purchase from landowners
                                that voluntarily sell to them.
                                <br>
                                <br> We support an immediate abolition of all environmentalist legislation that restricts the
                                right of U.S. companies to produce energy, and the establishment of a free market in energy.
                                <br>
                                <br> Such a free market involves eliminating all subsidies to both fossil fuel companies and
                                "alternative" or "green/renewable" energy companies, and a definitive end to government incentives
                                or penalties applied to the economic activity of any and all types of energy producers. We
                                confidently maintain that a free market in energy, similar to a free market in computer technology,
                                will attract brilliant minds dedicated to meeting mankind's energy needs across all technologies—and
                                that to do so effectively, government must be legally restricted from any and all forms of
                                interference. Such policies will ensure an America wealthy in inexpensive sources of energy,
                                and will make the United States again a world leader in energy production.

                                <br> Human beings—not swamps, wastelands, caribou, rats, or mosquitoes—hold supreme moral value.
                                We hold that what is morally right and proper is for human beings to develop and cultivate
                                the earth's resources in service of human life.
                                <br>
                                <br> The human environment is kept clean and safe primarily by advances in science, technology,
                                and industrialization.
                                <br>
                                <br> For example: development of steel and concrete enables construction of reservoirs, water
                                mains, indoor plumbing, and sewer mains that keep sewage out of the drinking water; advanced
                                technology enables men to drain swamps that are breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes;
                                heating and central air conditioning permit human beings to live comfortably in extreme climate
                                conditions, without breathing smoke from indoor fires; and so forth. Related, the protection
                                of private property rights is essential to effectively resolving legitimate cases of pollution.
                                If an individual dirties and limits the damage to his own property, that is his affair and
                                none of the government's. But if he pollutes somebody else's property, a claim against him
                                in civil court by one whose property he damaged must be upheld; a polluter must be held legally
                                responsible for remediating any property damage he incurred. Additionally, the upholding
                                of property rights enables environmentalist organizations, or others, to raise money and
                                purchase large wilderness tracts, to be kept forever wild, unused for human economic development.
                                <br>
                                <br> Regarding climate change, the earth is roughly 4.65 billion years old, possessing therefore
                                a vast history in which climate change occurs naturally and ceaselessly. For example, millions
                                of years ago, long before human beings existed, much less industrialized, huge naturally-driven
                                temperature swings—significantly larger than the 1.5 degree Fahrenheit rise of the past 150
                                years—caused the onset and, in time, the cessation of ice ages. We recognize that the best
                                opportunity for human life to flourish during such periods of severe cooling or warming is
                                provided by electric power, indoor heat, thermal clothing, advances in medical science, air
                                conditioning, sun screen, and the like—all products of applied science, technology, and industrialization.
                                Whether or not human industrial activity contributed to the slight warming of the past 150
                                years, two truths are certain: This mild warming, despite decades of alarmism, poses no immediate
                                catastrophic threat to human life—and government's restricting of the economic activity required
                                to attain flourishing life across all climates, is the exact opposite of a proper course
                                of action. Only a free society and a free market, upholding individual rights and freedom
                                of the mind, enables the advances in science, technology, and industrialization necessary
                                to protect human life from all of nature's dangers, including ice ages and other forms of
                                extreme (or mild) climate change, germs and disease, earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes,
                                tsunamis, and the like.

                                The primary purpose of an economy is to create wealth—goods and services—which benefits human beings at all socio-economic
                                levels.
                                <br>
                                <br> In a free society dedicated to production, full employment of all who voluntarily seek work
                                is a vital means to this end. It is gained by legally debarring government from interfering
                                in the labor markets. The right of employers and workers—non-union and union alike—to negotiate
                                freely and voluntarily, must be respected and protected by law. Just as we respect the right
                                of two men to form a marital contract, free from government interference, so we respect their
                                right to form an employment contract, similarly free from government interference. Government
                                interference in the labor markets, by either setting minimum wage laws or forcing employers
                                to negotiate exclusively with unions, results in wages set at levels higher than some people's
                                labor is worth to employers. In truth, it is impossible to make a man worth a specific salary
                                by legally prohibiting anyone from offering him a lesser amount. The result is, always and
                                everywhere, unemployment. Instead, we unequivocally support the right of employers to offer
                                wages that, in their judgment, reflect the productive ability of potential employees—and
                                the right of workers to voluntarily accept or decline the wages offered, or to negotiate
                                for salaries higher.
                                <br>
                                <br> Such a policy will encourage full employment and ensure that those new to the job market
                                and/or relatively unskilled can find employment and thereby earn money, gain experience,
                                demonstrate a diligent work ethic, build a resume, receive valuable on-the-job training,
                                and experience the pride of being self-supporting.

                                <br> The government has no moral right to coercively re-distribute income, meaning, no right

                                to those who did not create them—and it must be stripped of all legal authority to do so.
                                The energy with which the welfare state is upheld by many moralists, teachers, politicians,

                                We support a full, comprehensive, definitive, and universal abolition—now and forever, by inalterable Constitutional amendment—of
                                the government school system.
                                <br>
                                <br> All education, with no exception, in a free country must be privately done. We recognize
                                that government schools have no economic incentive to excel—that students are compelled to
                                attend, and that taxpayers are coerced to supply funding.
                                <br>
                                <br> Government schools, by the initiation of force, receive both students and money regardless
                                whether their educational product is effective or poor, often receiving increased funding
                                because their product is poor. Most Americans recognize that private schools are cognitively
                                superior to government schools but, taxed to support the failed government institutions,
                                are unable to pay twice for their children's education. With the abolition of the government
                                schools must come the repeal of the income and property taxes that finance them, making it
                                possible for hundreds of millions of Americans to now afford quality private education. Moreover,
                                a marketplace fully open to competition, teems with diverse options; for example, the American
                                restaurant industry offers a wide array of choices—from dozens of popular fast food chains
                                to diners, sandwich shops, family restaurants, ethnic restaurants, and all variations up
                                to and including tony establishments offering five star cuisine. (And American supermarkets
                                are a cornucopia of diverse foodstuffs to be purchased and prepared at home.) Similarly,
                                when the monolithic government school system is abolished and education is privatized, a
                                vast array of options will emerge to meet parental demand: More children will be homeschooled;
                                tutors will offer academic services in a wealth of subjects; teachers will open tiny individualized
                                schools; education corporations will be founded and open large-scale school systems across
                                the country; and on-line education will proliferate. There will be religious schools and
                                secular schools, academic programs and vocational schools, big-name prep schools and no-name
                                start-up schools, day schools and after-work night schools and weekend programs, thousands
                                upon thousands of options from among which adults—and parents and their children—will choose.

                                <br> By taking schooling out of the government's hands and placing it where it belongs—in the
                                hands of parents—we respect the right of individuals to choose the school they want for themselves
                                and their children, we definitively terminate governmental initiation of force in the educational
                                field, contributing to freedom of the mind, and we vastly improve the educational levels
                                in this country. We remember that prior to the imposition of government schooling in the
                                mid-19th century, private education in America was widespread and outstanding; that, for
                                example, Thomas Paine's Common Sense sold 120,000 copies to a free population of roughly
                                2.4 million, that the essays of The Federalist were written largely as newspaper editorials
                                to be read by the common man, and that, in the early 19th century, Walter Scott's novels
                                sold five million copies, the equivalent today of selling sixty million. A free market of
                                education has, and will again, deliver superlative levels of literacy in this nation.

                                at all levels utterly excluded by law. Medical payments will be made by patients, by their
                                private health insurance companies, and/or by voluntary charity organizations established
                                to help poor persons with medical costs, again with government legally excluded. We understand
                                that American health care, by physicians around the globe, is acknowledged as the world's
                                finest. As but one example, vastly more English, French, and German men die of prostate cancer
                                than do American men. But American medical care has become prodigiously expensive. At the
                                same time, not coincidentally, we recognize that the United States is no longer a capitalist
                                system, and has not been so for at least as far back as FDR's New Deal in the 1930s.

                                <br> It must be understood that the United States is, and has long been, a mixed economy—an unstable
                                amalgam of capitalism and socialism, of freedom and government controls, of individual rights
                                and statism.

                                <br> The two questions, in logic, are: Which part of the mixture is responsible for the superb
                                medical care? And which part of the amalgam is responsible for the skyrocketing cost?
                                <br>
                                <br> We recognize that, in any field, intellectual advance is wrought by free-thinking minds
                                operating under conditions of political-economic liberty; this is as true of MRI machines,
                                CT scans, arthroscopic surgery, illness-curing pharmaceuticals, and advanced cancer treatment
                                as it is of superlative novels, beautiful musical compositions, breakthroughs in theoretical
                                science, and such pioneering technologies as airplanes, automobiles, the electric light,
                                personal computers, and the Internet. It is the capitalist element of America's mixed economy—not
                                the socialist element—that is responsible for the country's superlative medical care.

                                generating a corresponding increase in supply. Prices then precipitously escalate. It is
                                the socialist element of America's mixed economy that is responsible for the skyrocketing
                                cost of American medical care.

                                surgical techniques, disease-detecting technology, as well as other life-saving developments.
                                We further maintain that a free medical marketplace, by upholding the responsibility of individuals
                                for their own medical expenses, and eliminating an economically disastrous third-party payer
                                system, will immensely reduce demand for medical services, thereby immensely reducing prices,
                                making quality medical care once again affordable for the overwhelming preponderance of U.S.
                                citizens.

                                We uphold this conviction: Open borders for honest immigrants is an application of the principle of individual rights to
                                those foreign born.

                                <br> Consequently, we support open borders for all honest men and women. We maintain that honest
                                individuals have the moral right to choose their country of residence, that the government
                                of a free society must uphold and protect that right, and that, in practical terms, the United
                                States throughout its history has greatly benefited from immigration. Andrew Carnegie, Ayn
                                Rand, Albert Einstein, Jerry Yang (co-founder of Yahoo), Sergey Brin (co-founder of Google),
                                Elon Musk (Founder of SpaceX and co-founder of Tesla Motors), Peter Thiel (co-founder of
                                PayPal), and numerous other geniuses and/or productive giants were and are immigrants to
                                America; Silicon Valley, for example, is heavily populated with expert, foreign-born engineers.
                                Related, labor force participation rates show that low-skilled immigrant laborers are and
                                have long been among American society's hardest workers. To those who argue that immigrants
                                freeload off of the welfare system, our response is dual: Factually, the welfare state is—overwhelmingly—a
                                problem of native-born Americans, not of immigrants, who generally manifest a superlative
                                work ethic; second, the welfare state must be utterly abolished on purely moral and humanitarian
                                grounds regardless of America's immigration policy.
                                <br>
                                <br> Eliminating the welfare state will ensure even further that only those willing to work productively
                                will immigrate to America.

                                bearing communicable diseases are, economically, more than offset by immense productivity
                                gained by welcoming such hard-working immigrants.

                                We recognize that all honest Americans benefit from legitimate government functions—the civil courts, the criminal justice
                                system, and a volunteer military.
                                <br>
                                <br> Consequently, it is morally just and proper that we pay a fee for governmental services
                                rendered.
                                <br>
                                <br> Freedom does not mean the moral right to freeload off of legitimate government services
                                paid for by others.
                                <br>
                                <br> Consequently, government—like any other service provider—has a right to demand and collect
                                fees for its necessary services, fees which can be referred to as proper taxation. Related:
                                When government's coercive activities are fully eliminated—when the government no longer
                                has the legal authority to establish a welfare state, to interfere in the productive activities
                                of honest individuals, or to violate the rights of innocent men and women in any form—the
                                cost of funding it is reduced to a fraction of its current amount. The expense of a proper,
                                rights-protecting government is roughly ten percent of government's current cost, averaging
                                to less than $2,000.00 per American; in practice, significantly less, because corporations,
                                pursuing their rational self-interest, needing contracts upheld, would pay relatively more
                                for their relatively greater use of the court system.
                                <br>

                                We fully endorse a woman's right to choose between abortion and motherhood.
                                <br>
                                <br> We recognize that a pregnant woman is an individual human being, with the right to her own
                                life, her own mind, and her own pursuit of happiness, including the right to terminate an
                                unwanted pregnancy. Conversely, a fetus early in the pregnancy is no more than a biological
                                dependency within a woman's body, incapable of biologically autonomous life, utterly reliant
                                upon the mother's life support functions. It is not the first-trimester fetus's unformed
                                digestive system that digests food for it, but the mother's; not the fetus's lungs which
                                respirate for it, but the mother's; not the fetus's brain that controls such life-support
                                activities, but the mother's; and so forth.
                                <br>
                                <br> We maintain that a minimal requirement of attaining the status of human personhood is to
                                be a biological individual—an entity, not a component—and that an early-pregnancy, unformed
                                fetus, although undoubtedly alive, and potentially a human being, is no more a human life
                                than is an acorn an oak tree.
                                <br> We maintain that the capacity for biologically-independent life, the ability to self-generate
                                one's own life support functions, is a fundamental criterion of bodily individuation and
                                constitutes a necessary condition for the attainment of human personhood. We recognize that
                                such biologic viability is not reached until—roughly—the end of the second trimester, and
                                that this point in development, and in time, forms the proper demarcation between moral permissibility
                                and impermissibility of abortion.
                                <br>
                                <br> A woman is an organically-formed, biological individual—a human being; an undeveloped fetus
                                is not.
                                <br>
                                <br> Consequently, one has an inalienable right to life; the other does not. As a responsible
                                human individual, an adult, a pregnant woman is as responsible to finance her abortion as
                                she is to finance her child—or to do so with the voluntary assistance of other private individuals,
                                including and especially the father, who choose to help. Government at any and all levels,
                                whether federal or state, must be legally debarred from funding abortion and from coercing
                                taxpayers to financially support it.

                                <br>
                                <br> This includes legal recognition of the right of gay and lesbian individuals to form lifetime
                                unions. Which sexual actions are performed by consenting adults is no business of other individuals,
                                of society as a whole, and, above all, of the government. The government has no moral authority
                                to discriminate between and among individuals based on sexual orientation. Its nature and
                                function is to protect individual rights regardless if its elected officials or appointed

                                <br> At the same time, we recognize that bigots—regardless the irrationality of their beliefs—also
                                have rights. If a bigot—regarding his home, property, or business—refuses to deal with homosexuals
                                (or any persons of whom he disapproves, for whatever reason, including the most ignorant,
                                irrational, or vile), that is part of his or her inalienable right to his own property. An
                                individual, by virtue of being an ignoramus, does not relinquish his right to the use and
                                disposal of his property.
                                <br>
                                <br> Even irrational persons—as long as they do not initiate force or fraud—have rights.
                                <br>
                                <br> We morally demand that the government of a free country protect the rights of all non-criminal
                                individuals—including those of irrational bigots. Further, we morally commend all rational
                                men and women to combat ignorant bigots—including those who discriminate against gays—by
                                means that do not violate the bigots' rights: by education, ethical training, moral condemnation,
                                social ostracism, and/or economic boycott. We recognize that such means bring truly positive
                                social changes: a commitment to reason and to the protection of the rights of all individuals—and
                                to a ban on the initiation of force, including, and especially, by the government.

                                <br>
                                <br> Practically, we recognize that the attempt—by making toxic drugs illegal—to prevent Americans
                                from imbibing such substances is a colossal and colossally expensive failure. Related, Prohibition,
                                almost a century ago—the war on alcohol—was a similarly abysmal failure. From such examples,
                                can be drawn a conclusion: It is impossible to prevent procurement of x by criminalizing
                                the purchase or ownership of x. There is an economic principle involved: If x is in demand—if
                                people both desire and have the purchasing power to buy x—then money can be made by supplying
                                it. If x is legal, it is supplied by honest businessmen; if x is illegal, it is supplied
                                by gangsters. Either way, x is supplied. We maintain that the legal war on drugs is both
                                a moral abomination and a practical disaster.
                                <br>
                                <br> We call for the immediate legalization of all drugs, a policy which will have numerous consequences,
                                all of them benign. Legalization will protect the right of adult citizens to govern their
                                lives by their own judgment (regarding an important social issue, it will legally ban governmental
                                initiation of force against innocent citizens); it will place the drug business in the hands
                                of honest businessmen; it will strip of enormous profit and consequently of enormous power
                                the vile gangsters who currently traffic in illicit drugs; it will significantly lower the
                                homicide rate in this country; it will save the American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars
                                per year; it will end the persecution (and prosecution) of those whose only "crime" is the
                                purchase, ownership, or consumption of a banned substance; and it will thereby free up law
                                enforcement assets to concentrate full-time on the apprehension of violent criminals, jihadists,
                                and any others that initiate either force or fraud against innocent victims.
                                <br>
                                <br> Above all, we hold that terminating the failed legal war on drugs, enables a vastly more
                                powerful and effective war on drugs.
                                <br>
                                <br> For all rational and healthy persons of goodwill, who care about their brothers and sisters,
                                and who sincerely seek to prevent tragically unnecessary deaths from drug use, the responsibility
                                is now squarely on our shoulders: By living a clean, healthy, responsible, and joyous life,
                                we are a beacon for anyone with eyes to see. Walking the walk, we can now effectively talk
                                the talk: We teach our children, our students, our neighbors, colleagues, family members,
                                and friends about the myriad values life potentially holds out to them—about education, productive
                                career, romantic love, children, dear friends, and many others—and about the insanity of
                                risking all this for a few moments of a drug-induced "high."
                                <br>
                                <br> We initiate no force against our fellows but appeal to the best within them—to their reason
                                and to their love of life.
                                <br>
                                <br> We thereby respect their right of choice—we respect their reasoning mind—we appeal to their
                                better judgment. And by means of such a philosophic-moral-educational war on drugs, we will
                                save vastly more lives than ever did the failed legal war on drugs.

                                The only proper role of government is to protect individual rights.
                                <br>
                                <br> Consequently and in actual practice, it is as necessary for the government of a free country
                                to protect innocent citizens against foreign aggressors as it is to protect them against
                                domestic criminals. Terrifyingly, the history of the past century shows no shortage of foreign
                                aggressors ready and able to assail America and/or murder Americans—among them, National
                                Socialists (Nazis), Communists, and Islamists.
                                <br> It is tragically true that, in such a world, the United States—while passionately upholding
                                individual rights, the non-initiation of force, and peace—must be prepared to effectively
                                defend itself against those who would initiate force against it.
                                <br> Therefore, we stand for a strong United States military, and for willingness to use that
                                military, around the globe if necessary, to defend America, Americans, and the property of
                                Americans.
                                <br>
                                <br> To protect the rights of American citizens, the United States government must pursue a foreign
                                policy of rational self-interest.
                                <br>
                                <br> The government must protect the rights, the lives, and the property of Americans internationally,
                                and it must protect the right of Americans to trade voluntarily with productive individuals
                                and companies overseas. The United States should be a good friend and trading partner to
                                free nations across the globe, an outspoken moral critic of dictators everywhere, and a fearsome
                                foe to dictatorships that threaten or attack it or its citizens.
                                <br> In World War II, the United States used its full technologic, industrial, and military might
                                to utterly destroy the tyrannical regimes that assailed it. This must be the template for
                                dealing with those enemies that physically threaten or assault America and/or Americans.
                                <br>
                                <br> The moral principle that must be made clear to potential assailants is: Leave us in peace—or
                                be utterly and totally annihilated. You have no other alternative.
                                <br>
                                <br> We value freedom, individual rights, the non-initiation of force, and the prosperity and
                                peace that follow in their train. We neither prize nor seek the horrors of war. But to those
                                that physically attack America and/or Americans, our response will be war—not a war of nation-building,
                                not a war calculated to win hearts and minds, but a war of annihilation. Let our enemies
                                beware.
                                <br>
                                <br> We emphasize that military service in a free society must be purely on a voluntary basis;
                                for to defend a free country, that country must be free.
                                <br>
                                <br> There must never again be a military draft—or a draft of any kind, for whatever purpose—in
                                the United States.

                                We fully and firmly support the right of all honest men and women to own weapons.
                                <br>
                                <br> Morally, it is the inalienable right of an innocent individual—one who initiates neither
                                force nor fraud—to own weapons, including guns. Practically, honest persons are then better
                                equipped to defend themselves against criminal assault. Further, we maintain that there is
                                an even more important practical reason for honest men and women to own and to know how to
                                use guns: The ability to defend their rights and lives against a government devolving into
                                dictatorship. History shows that oppressive regimes, to maintain brutal control over their
                                subjects, impose stringent gun control laws.
                                <br>
                                <br> Not surprisingly, history also shows that disarmed civilians are powerless to protect themselves
                                against a dictator's murderous atrocities—but that armed civilians, prepared and able to
                                defend their rights and lives, stand a vastly greater chance of survival.
                                <br>
                                <br> Related, a civilian populace, armed and proficient in the use of guns, forms an effective
                                bulwark against foreign invaders. As but one illustrious example, the American Minutemen—farmers
                                and shopkeepers, not soldiers—owning and effective in the use of muskets, defeated troops
                                of the British Empire at Lexington and Concord, thereby catalyzing a successful uprising
                                for freedom. For reasons both moral and practical, for purposes of effective self-defense
                                against both criminals and dictators, we fully and firmly support the right of honest men
                                and women to bear arms.

                            <br> If the United States universally upholds and protects the principle of individual rights, as
                            it should, it thereby provides safe haven for the greatest of mankind's thinkers, who will flock
                            to this country—as they once did—from all over the world. The result is that geniuses both native-born
                            and immigrant will once again transfigure our culture in every conceivable field—as did, historically,
                            Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, the Wright brothers, George

                            <br> When an individual's life belongs to him, it follows logically that his mind belongs to him—and
                            he thinks, speaks, and acts in accordance with his own judgment. Creative geniuses are thereby
                            liberated to originate new ideas, theories, books, and technologies, whether or not these are
                            approved by secular or religious authorities. When freedom of the mind is protected by constitutional
                            law, brilliant thinkers create flourishing civilization.
                            <br> Conversely, when an individual's life belongs to the state, it follows logically that his mind

                                There should exist a strict legal separation of state and economy in the United States, just as, and for the same reason,
                                there exists a legal separation of state and church. Just as religious belief and practice
                                is—properly—a matter of private choice and initiative, so are men's economic choices and
                                activities. As long as individuals are not criminals—i.e., as long as they do not initiate
                                force or fraud against innocent victims—their right to their own beliefs, their own choices,
                                and their own activities, material as well as spiritual, must be upheld and protected by
                                the legal system. The first clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states,

                                <br> We full-mindedly and wholeheartedly agree. Similarly, we support a Constitutional amendment
                                stating,
                                <br>

                                <span class="quote">"Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of economic regulations, or restricting
                                    the free exercise of voluntary production and trade."</span>
                                <br>
                                <br> If business persons, like religious persons or clergy, initiate force or fraud, they should
                                be properly prosecuted under the laws of the criminal justice system. But if they initiate
                                neither force nor fraud, then the government must be constitutionally debarred from interfering
                                with their activities. Two centuries of capitalism and millennia of statism demonstrate two
                                practical conclusions: When men's rights are protected to freely engage in production and
                                trade, immense advances result in innovations, in creation of both material and intellectual
                                wealth, in living standards, and in human life expectancies—but when men's rights to voluntarily
                                produce and trade are curtailed by government, when statism in any form is rampant, then
                                progress ceases, the creation of wealth plummets, living standards diminish, and life expectancies
                                decline.

                                <br>
                                <br> Such a free market involves eliminating all subsidies to both fossil fuel companies and
                                "alternative" or "green/renewable" energy companies, and a definitive end to government incentives

                                confidently maintain that a free market in energy, similar to a free market in computer technology,
                                will attract brilliant minds dedicated to meeting mankind's energy needs across all technologies—and
                                that to do so effectively, government must be legally restricted from any and all forms of

                                <br> Human beings—not swamps, wastelands, caribou, rats, or mosquitoes—hold supreme moral value.
                                We hold that what is morally right and proper is for human beings to develop and cultivate
                                the earth's resources in service of human life.
                                <br>
                                <br> The human environment is kept clean and safe primarily by advances in science, technology,
                                and industrialization.
                                <br>
                                <br> For example: development of steel and concrete enables construction of reservoirs, water
                                mains, indoor plumbing, and sewer mains that keep sewage out of the drinking water; advanced
                                technology enables men to drain swamps that are breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes;
                                heating and central air conditioning permit human beings to live comfortably in extreme climate
                                conditions, without breathing smoke from indoor fires; and so forth. Related, the protection
                                of private property rights is essential to effectively resolving legitimate cases of pollution.
                                If an individual dirties and limits the damage to his own property, that is his affair and
                                none of the government's. But if he pollutes somebody else's property, a claim against him
                                in civil court by one whose property he damaged must be upheld; a polluter must be held legally
                                responsible for remediating any property damage he incurred. Additionally, the upholding
                                of property rights enables environmentalist organizations, or others, to raise money and
                                purchase large wilderness tracts, to be kept forever wild, unused for human economic development.
                                <br>
                                <br> Regarding climate change, the earth is roughly 4.65 billion years old, possessing therefore
                                a vast history in which climate change occurs naturally and ceaselessly. For example, millions
                                of years ago, long before human beings existed, much less industrialized, huge naturally-driven
                                temperature swings—significantly larger than the 1.5 degree Fahrenheit rise of the past 150
                                years—caused the onset and, in time, the cessation of ice ages. We recognize that the best
                                opportunity for human life to flourish during such periods of severe cooling or warming is
                                provided by electric power, indoor heat, thermal clothing, advances in medical science, air
                                conditioning, sun screen, and the like—all products of applied science, technology, and industrialization.
                                Whether or not human industrial activity contributed to the slight warming of the past 150
                                years, two truths are certain: This mild warming, despite decades of alarmism, poses no immediate
                                catastrophic threat to human life—and government's restricting of the economic activity required
                                to attain flourishing life across all climates, is the exact opposite of a proper course
                                of action. Only a free society and a free market, upholding individual rights and freedom
                                of the mind, enables the advances in science, technology, and industrialization necessary
                                to protect human life from all of nature's dangers, including ice ages and other forms of
                                extreme (or mild) climate change, germs and disease, earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes,
                                tsunamis, and the like. </span>

                                <br> In a free society dedicated to production, full employment of all who voluntarily seek work
                                is a vital means to this end. It is gained by legally debarring government from interfering
                                in the labor markets. The right of employers and workers—non-union and union alike—to negotiate
                                freely and voluntarily, must be respected and protected by law. Just as we respect the right
                                of two men to form a marital contract, free from government interference, so we respect their
                                right to form an employment contract, similarly free from government interference. Government
                                interference in the labor markets, by either setting minimum wage laws or forcing employers
                                to negotiate exclusively with unions, results in wages set at levels higher than some people's
                                labor is worth to employers. In truth, it is impossible to make a man worth a specific salary
                                by legally prohibiting anyone from offering him a lesser amount. The result is, always and
                                everywhere, unemployment. Instead, we unequivocally support the right of employers to offer
                                wages that, in their judgment, reflect the productive ability of potential employees—and
                                the right of workers to voluntarily accept or decline the wages offered, or to negotiate
                                for salaries higher.

                                spending and saving, between higher living standards during working years and increased resources
                                for retirement, must be upheld by law. To this end,

                                <br> All education, with no exception, in a free country must be privately done. We recognize
                                that government schools have no economic incentive to excel—that students are compelled to
                                attend, and that taxpayers are coerced to supply funding.
                                <br>
                                <br> Government schools, by the initiation of force, receive both students and money regardless
                                whether their educational product is effective or poor, often receiving increased funding
                                because their product is poor. Most Americans recognize that private schools are cognitively
                                superior to government schools but, taxed to support the failed government institutions,
                                are unable to pay twice for their children's education. With the abolition of the government
                                schools must come the repeal of the income and property taxes that finance them, making it
                                possible for hundreds of millions of Americans to now afford quality private education. Moreover,
                                a marketplace fully open to competition, teems with diverse options; for example, the American
                                restaurant industry offers a wide array of choices—from dozens of popular fast food chains
                                to diners, sandwich shops, family restaurants, ethnic restaurants, and all variations up
                                to and including tony establishments offering five star cuisine. (And American supermarkets
                                are a cornucopia of diverse foodstuffs to be purchased and prepared at home.) Similarly,
                                when the monolithic government school system is abolished and education is privatized, a
                                vast array of options will emerge to meet parental demand: More children will be homeschooled;
                                tutors will offer academic services in a wealth of subjects; teachers will open tiny individualized
                                schools; education corporations will be founded and open large-scale school systems across
                                the country; and on-line education will proliferate. There will be religious schools and
                                secular schools, academic programs and vocational schools, big-name prep schools and no-name
                                start-up schools, day schools and after-work night schools and weekend programs, thousands
                                upon thousands of options from among which adults—and parents and their children—will choose.
                                <br>
                                <br> By taking schooling out of the government's hands and placing it where it belongs—in the
                                hands of parents—we respect the right of individuals to choose the school they want for themselves
                                and their children, we definitively terminate governmental initiation of force in the educational
                                field, contributing to freedom of the mind, and we vastly improve the educational levels
                                in this country. We remember that prior to the imposition of government schooling in the
                                mid-19th century, private education in America was widespread and outstanding; that, for
                                example, Thomas Paine's Common Sense sold 120,000 copies to a free population of roughly
                                2.4 million, that the essays of The Federalist were written largely as newspaper editorials
                                to be read by the common man, and that, in the early 19th century, Walter Scott's novels
                                sold five million copies, the equivalent today of selling sixty million. A free market of
                                education has, and will again, deliver superlative levels of literacy in this nation. </span>

                                at all levels utterly excluded by law. Medical payments will be made by patients, by their

                                to help poor persons with medical costs, again with government legally excluded. We understand
                                that American health care, by physicians around the globe, is acknowledged as the world's
                                finest. As but one example, vastly more English, French, and German men die of prostate cancer
                                than do American men. But American medical care has become prodigiously expensive. At the
                                same time, not coincidentally, we recognize that the United States is no longer a capitalist
                                system, and has not been so for at least as far back as FDR's New Deal in the 1930s.
                                <br>
                                <br> It must be understood that the United States is, and has long been, a mixed economy—an unstable
                                amalgam of capitalism and socialism, of freedom and government controls, of individual rights
                                and statism.
                                <br>
                                <br> The two questions, in logic, are: Which part of the mixture is responsible for the superb
                                medical care? And which part of the amalgam is responsible for the skyrocketing cost?
                                <br>
                                <br> We recognize that, in any field, intellectual advance is wrought by free-thinking minds
                                operating under conditions of political-economic liberty; this is as true of MRI machines,
                                CT scans, arthroscopic surgery, illness-curing pharmaceuticals, and advanced cancer treatment
                                as it is of superlative novels, beautiful musical compositions, breakthroughs in theoretical
                                science, and such pioneering technologies as airplanes, automobiles, the electric light,
                                personal computers, and the Internet. It is the capitalist element of America's mixed economy—not
                                the socialist element—that is responsible for the country's superlative medical care.
                                <br>
                                <br> Conversely, we maintain that a third-party payer system, backed and enabled by government
                                intervention in the healthcare field, has immensely boosted demand for medical services without
                                generating a corresponding increase in supply. Prices then precipitously escalate. It is
                                the socialist element of America's mixed economy that is responsible for the skyrocketing
                                cost of American medical care.

                                for their own medical expenses, and eliminating an economically disastrous third-party payer
                                system, will immensely reduce demand for medical services, thereby immensely reducing prices,

                                Silicon Valley, for example, is heavily populated with expert, foreign-born engineers. Related,
                                labor force participation rates show that low-skilled immigrant laborers are and have long
                                been among American society's hardest workers. To those who argue that immigrants freeload
                                off of the welfare system, our response is dual: Factually, the welfare state is—overwhelmingly—a
                                problem of native-born Americans, not of immigrants, who generally manifest a superlative
                                work ethic; second, the welfare state must be utterly abolished on purely moral and humanitarian
                                grounds regardless of America's immigration policy.
                                <br>
                                <br> Eliminating the welfare state will ensure even further that only those willing to work productively

                                upon the mother's life support functions. It is not the first-trimester fetus's unformed
                                digestive system that digests food for it, but the mother's; not the fetus's lungs which
                                respirate for it, but the mother's; not the fetus's brain that controls such life-support
                                activities, but the mother's; and so forth.
                                <br>
                                <br> We maintain that a minimal requirement of attaining the status of human personhood is to
                                be a biological individual—an entity, not a component—and that an early-pregnancy, unformed
                                fetus, although undoubtedly alive, and potentially a human being, is no more a human life
                                than is an acorn an oak tree.
                                <br> We maintain that the capacity for biologically-independent life, the ability to self-generate
                                one's own life support functions, is a fundamental criterion of bodily individuation and
                                constitutes a necessary condition for the attainment of human personhood. We recognize that
                                such biologic viability is not reached until—roughly—the end of the second trimester, and
                                that this point in development, and in time, forms the proper demarcation between moral permissibility
                                and impermissibility of abortion.
                                <br>
                                <br> A woman is an organically-formed, biological individual—a human being; an undeveloped fetus
                                is not.
                                <br>
                                <br> Consequently, one has an inalienable right to life; the other does not. As a responsible
                                human individual, an adult, a pregnant woman is as responsible to finance her abortion as
                                she is to finance her child—or to do so with the voluntary assistance of other private individuals,
                                including and especially the father, who choose to help. Government at any and all levels,
                                whether federal or state, must be legally debarred from funding abortion and from coercing
                                taxpayers to financially support it.

                                of society as a whole, and, above all, of the government. The government has no moral authority
                                to discriminate between and among individuals based on sexual orientation. Its nature and
                                function is to protect individual rights regardless if its elected officials or appointed

                                have rights. If a bigot—regarding his home, property, or business—refuses to deal with homosexuals
                                (or any persons of whom he disapproves, for whatever reason, including the most ignorant,
                                irrational, or vile), that is part of his or her inalienable right to his own property. An
                                individual, by virtue of being an ignoramus, does not relinquish his right to the use and
                                disposal of his property.
                                <br>
                                <br> Even irrational persons—as long as they do not initiate force or fraud—have rights.

                                <br> We morally demand that the government of a free country protect the rights of all non-criminal

                                means that do not violate the bigots' rights: by education, ethical training, moral condemnation,
                                social ostracism, and/or economic boycott. We recognize that such means bring truly positive
                                social changes: a commitment to reason and to the protection of the rights of all individuals—and
                                to a ban on the initiation of force, including, and especially, by the government.

                                use, we uphold the inalienable right of adult citizens in a free society to choose which
                                drugs, if any, they will imbibe.
                                <br>
                                <br> Although the choice to use potentially lethal drugs is a self-destructive one, we hold that
                                an individual's inalienable right to his or her own life includes the right to irrationally
                                risk it. The government of a free country has no moral authority to dictate to adult individuals
                                the substances they may or may not be permitted to use.
                                <br>
                                <br> Practically, we recognize that the attempt—by making toxic drugs illegal—to prevent Americans
                                from imbibing such substances is a colossal and colossally expensive failure. Related, Prohibition,
                                almost a century ago—the war on alcohol—was a similarly abysmal failure. From such examples,
                                can be drawn a conclusion: It is impossible to prevent procurement of x by criminalizing
                                the purchase or ownership of x. There is an economic principle involved: If x is in demand—if
                                people both desire and have the purchasing power to buy x—then money can be made by supplying
                                it. If x is legal, it is supplied by honest businessmen; if x is illegal, it is supplied
                                by gangsters. Either way, x is supplied. We maintain that the legal war on drugs is both
                                a moral abomination and a practical disaster.
                                <br>
                                <br> We call for the immediate legalization of all drugs, a policy which will have numerous consequences,
                                all of them benign. Legalization will protect the right of adult citizens to govern their
                                lives by their own judgment (regarding an important social issue, it will legally ban governmental
                                initiation of force against innocent citizens); it will place the drug business in the hands
                                of honest businessmen; it will strip of enormous profit and consequently of enormous power
                                the vile gangsters who currently traffic in illicit drugs; it will significantly lower the
                                homicide rate in this country; it will save the American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars
                                per year; it will end the persecution (and prosecution) of those whose only "crime" is the
                                purchase, ownership, or consumption of a banned substance; and it will thereby free up law
                                enforcement assets to concentrate full-time on the apprehension of violent criminals, jihadists,
                                and any others that initiate either force or fraud against innocent victims.
                                <br>
                                <br> Above all, we hold that terminating the failed legal war on drugs, enables a vastly more
                                powerful and effective war on drugs.
                                <br>
                                <br> For all rational and healthy persons of goodwill, who care about their brothers and sisters,
                                and who sincerely seek to prevent tragically unnecessary deaths from drug use, the responsibility
                                is now squarely on our shoulders: By living a clean, healthy, responsible, and joyous life,
                                we are a beacon for anyone with eyes to see. Walking the walk, we can now effectively talk
                                the talk: We teach our children, our students, our neighbors, colleagues, family members,
                                and friends about the myriad values life potentially holds out to them—about education, productive
                                career, romantic love, children, dear friends, and many others—and about the insanity of
                                risking all this for a few moments of a drug-induced "high."
                                <br>
                                <br> We initiate no force against our fellows but appeal to the best within them—to their reason
                                and to their love of life.
                                <br>
                                <br> We thereby respect their right of choice—we respect their reasoning mind—we appeal to their
                                better judgment. And by means of such a philosophic-moral-educational war on drugs, we will
                                save vastly more lives than ever did the failed legal war on drugs.

                                <br> Consequently and in actual practice, it is as necessary for the government of a free country
                                to protect innocent citizens against foreign aggressors as it is to protect them against
                                domestic criminals. Terrifyingly, the history of the past century shows no shortage of foreign
                                aggressors ready and able to assail America and/or murder Americans—among them, National
                                Socialists (Nazis), Communists, and Islamists.
                                <br> It is tragically true that, in such a world, the United States—while passionately upholding

                                defend itself against those who would initiate force against it.
                                <br> Therefore, we stand for a strong United States military, and for willingness to use that
                                military, around the globe if necessary, to defend America, Americans, and the property of
                                Americans.

                                <br> To protect the rights of American citizens, the United States government must pursue a foreign
                                policy of rational self-interest.

                                <br> The government must protect the rights, the lives, and the property of Americans internationally,
                                and it must protect the right of Americans to trade voluntarily with productive individuals
                                and companies overseas. The United States should be a good friend and trading partner to
                                free nations across the globe, an outspoken moral critic of dictators everywhere, and a fearsome
                                foe to dictatorships that threaten or attack it or its citizens.
                                <br> In World War II, the United States used its full technologic, industrial, and military might
                                to utterly destroy the tyrannical regimes that assailed it. This must be the template for
                                dealing with those enemies that physically threaten or assault America and/or Americans.

                                <br> The moral principle that must be made clear to potential assailants is: Leave us in peace—or
                                be utterly and totally annihilated. You have no other alternative.
                                <br>
                                <br> We value freedom, individual rights, the non-initiation of force, and the prosperity and
                                peace that follow in their train. We neither prize nor seek the horrors of war. But to those
                                that physically attack America and/or Americans, our response will be war—not a war of nation-building,
                                not a war calculated to win hearts and minds, but a war of annihilation. Let our enemies
                                beware.

                                force nor fraud—to own weapons, including guns. Practically, honest persons are then better
                                equipped to defend themselves against criminal assault. Further, we maintain that there is
                                an even more important practical reason for honest men and women to own and to know how to
                                use guns: The ability to defend their rights and lives against a government devolving into
                                dictatorship. History shows that oppressive regimes, to maintain brutal control over their
                                subjects, impose stringent gun control laws.
                                <br>
                                <br> Not surprisingly, history also shows that disarmed civilians are powerless to protect themselves
                                against a dictator's murderous atrocities—but that armed civilians, prepared and able to
                                defend their rights and lives, stand a vastly greater chance of survival.
                                <br>
                                <br> Related, a civilian populace, armed and proficient in the use of guns, forms an effective
                                bulwark against foreign invaders. As but one illustrious example, the American Minutemen—farmers
                                and shopkeepers, not soldiers—owning and effective in the use of muskets, defeated troops
                                of the British Empire at Lexington and Concord, thereby catalyzing a successful uprising
                                for freedom. For reasons both moral and practical, for purposes of effective self-defense
                                against both criminals and dictators, we fully and firmly support the right of honest men
                                and women to bear arms.

                            <br> If the United States universally upholds and protects the principle of individual rights, as
                            it should, it thereby provides safe haven for the greatest of mankind's thinkers, who will flock
                            to this country—as they once did—from all over the world. The result is that geniuses both native-born
                            and immigrant will once again transfigure our culture in every conceivable field—as did, historically,
                            Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, the Wright brothers, George
                            Washington Carver, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Maria Montessori, Albert Einstein, Ayn
                            Rand, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and a host of others.

                            <br>
                            <br> When an individual's life belongs to him, it follows logically that his mind belongs to him—and
                            he thinks, speaks, and acts in accordance with his own judgment. Creative geniuses are thereby
                            liberated to originate new ideas, theories, books, and technologies, whether or not these are
                            approved by secular or religious authorities. When freedom of the mind is protected by constitutional
                            law, brilliant thinkers create flourishing civilization.
                            <br> Conversely, when an individual's life belongs to the state, it follows logically that his mind
                            belongs to the state—and he thinks, speaks, and acts only in accordance with the state's commands.
